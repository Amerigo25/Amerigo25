## 🚀 Featured Project: **LLMOps Dashboard (WIP)**

> A production-style agent platform for:
> - Running, debugging and visualizing LangGraph agents
> - Monitoring token usage, latency, and cost
> - A/B testing prompts and managing agent configs
> - UI via Chainlit + FastAPI backend + PostgreSQL + Grafana

> → Built to solidify real-world use of **async programming**, **agent observability**, and **frontend/backend orchestration**
