## Hi there 👋 I'm Amerigo

🎛 **Software Engineer | Generative AI Specialist | Creative Coder**

I'm a software engineer with a strong background in **machine learning**, **signal processing**, and **creative coding**. I hold a Master's degree in ICT for Internet and Multimedia from the University of Padova, where I focused on AI, computer vision, and multimedia systems.

I currently work at **Liquid Reply** on the **AI Modernization Team**, where we build advanced AI agents and deploy them at scale using modern cloud infrastructure.

### 🌀 Featured Project: AI-Enhanced Live Performance 🎶

In our latest work for the **AI Music Contest / Kappa FuturFestival**, I collaborated on a 10-minute **audio-visual DJ set** powered by:

- 🎧 **Real-time audio feature extraction** (onset, energy, ZCR) with `librosa`
- 💻 **Live visuals rendered with GLSL**, interfaced through `ModernGL` in `Python`
- 🧠 **AI-generated imagery and development support via GPT-4o**
- 🎚 Built for responsiveness, immersion, and high-energy techno/electro flow
